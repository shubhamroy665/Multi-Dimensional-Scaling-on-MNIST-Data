# Multi-Dimensional-Scaling-on-MNIST-Data
we implement the Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm from scratch to visualize high-dimensional data from the MNIST dataset in a lower-dimensional space. MDS is a technique used for visualizing the similarity or dissimilarity of data points while preserving their pairwise distances as much as possible.
